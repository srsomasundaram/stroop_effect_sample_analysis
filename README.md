The samples of congruent and incongruent tests under Stroop effect are analysed
Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
In this project we analyze the experimental psychology (viz.) the Stroop Effect. In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration 
of interference in the reaction time of a task. When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in a color that is not denoted by the name (e.g., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. The effect is named after John Ridley Stroop, who first published the effect in English in 1935. The effect had previously been published in Germany in 1929. The original paper has been one of the most cited papers in the history of experimental psychology, leading to more than 701 replications. The effect has been used to create a psychological test (Stroop test) that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.
In the following analysis, Congruent test means printing the name of the color in the same color as the name and finding out the Reaction time. On the other hand, Incongruent test means, printing the name of the color in a color NOT denoting the color to find out the Reaction time.
